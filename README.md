# GuessTheCar-Quiz
This is my first attempt at creating a full front end web game. The game will be built using solely Javascript/Jquery. Bootstrap as UI Framework holding the game. 'Guess The Car' is played using radio buttons in relation to a display image above. The game will display cropped images of vehicles and the user must guess which brand/model the image is of. The initial goal of the game is to hardcode a library with questions/answers. The first large project will be to pull images directly from my Photography page to have the user play with a library of my personal photos. Future developments will be to use HTML crawlers and Instagram's API to pull specific car images from the web.
